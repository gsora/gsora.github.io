  <h1 class="post-title">Dissecting a fake breadwallet iOS app</h1>
  <time class="post-date">Thu, Aug 11, 2016</time>
  <pre><code>Disclaimer: I do not work for breadwallet, anything you'll read in this article is not endorsed by them; I am fairly new to mobile app security too, so expect errors.
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>Bitcoin is a nice way of thinking about money: you&rsquo;re your bank, anyone knows anything about your assets and vice versa, it&rsquo;s decentralized.</p>

<p>But since you&rsquo;re the only one responsible for your money, a single error can - and <em>will</em> - lead to bad consequences.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Today I&rsquo;ll talk about this last part because since the beginning of August 2016, someone is trying to scam iOS Bitcoin holders - often newcomers - faking one of the most used wallet on this platform, <strong>breadwallet</strong>.</p>

<p>iOS is a fairly secure platform, but this fake entity found a method to circumvent the AppStore app review process, uploading many fraudolent version of breadwallet.</p>

<p>These fake versions tend to have the same behaviour: they&rsquo;re almost identical to official apps in both look and functionality, but they steal coins instead.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.gsora.xyz/assets/images/breadywallet-apps.png"><img src="http://blog.gsora.xyz/assets/images/breadywallet-apps.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width:50%"></a></p>

<h2 id="ios-application-reverse-engineering-101">iOS application reverse engineering 101</h2>

<p>Reversing a binary built for iOS isn&rsquo;t a straightforward process, because Apple encrypts every binary they push on the AppStore.</p>

<p>To be able to reverse anything, the first thing to do is proceed to jailbreak a physical iOS device - in this case I used an iPhone 6s.</p>

<p>This way it&rsquo;s far more easier to decrypt a packaged AppStore binary, and it&rsquo;s possible to take a look to what the application does on the device itself: since I&rsquo;m looking for anomalies, better look everywhere.</p>

<p>A quick search on the AppStore for &ldquo;breadwallet&rdquo; gave me this interesting clone called &ldquo;breadywallet&rdquo; (notice the extra &lsquo;y&rsquo;), that appears as &ldquo;Hangman&rdquo; on the SpringBoard.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.gsora.xyz/assets/images/breadywallet-appstore.png"><img src="http://blog.gsora.xyz/assets/images/breadywallet-appstore.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width:50%"></a></p>

<p>Of course, I already downloaded (and used with much success) the official application on my device.</p>

<p>To decrypt an AppStore binary I used the excellent <a href="https://github.com/KJCracks/Clutch">Clutch</a>, as suggested by the <a href="http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Reverse_Engineering_Tools#Clutch">iPhoneDevWiki</a>.</p>

<p>AppStore binaries are placed in <code>/var/containers/Bundle/Application</code>, but the folders containing actual binaries are renamed after an UUID - a quick bash oneliner can help us find the wallets:</p>

<pre><code>iDjentleman:~ root# find /private/var/containers/Bundle/Application -maxdepth 2 -type d -name &quot;*wallet.app&quot; -exec echo {} \;
</code></pre>

<p>Running this command will reveal something interesting:</p>

<pre><code>/private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/4F76E2BF-3A60-4349-B8CA-52B808108981/breadwallet.app

/private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/BB79C9DE-BBA9-4B39-B959-E085EEC67682/breadwallet.app
</code></pre>

<p>How can we distinguish between the fake app and the official one?<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Every iOS application embeds a metadata file - <code>iTunesMetadata.plist</code>; using <code>plutil</code> we can check for the software Bundle ID (which should be unique for every application on the AppStore):</p>

<pre><code># cd /private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/4F76E2BF-3A60-4349-B8CA-52B808108981/
# plutil iTunesMetadata.plist | grep softwareVersionBundleId
    softwareVersionBundleId = breadywallet;
</code></pre>

<p>Oh! Looks like we found the impostor!</p>

<p>After installing Clutch on the device, decrypting the binary is a matter of seconds:</p>

<pre><code>iDjentleman:~ root# ./clutch  -b breadywallet
ASLR slide: 0x1000b8000
Dumping &lt;breadwallet&gt; (arm64)
Patched cryptid (64bit segment)
Writing new checksum
Finished dumping breadywallet to /var/tmp/clutch/4B395DF4-9644-4A5D-8F03-4F2494FF6FB2
Finished dumping breadywallet in 0.9 seconds
</code></pre>

<p>Clutch only managed to decrypt the arm64 build because my iPhone is on iOS 9.3.2 and this major release introduced Bitcode.</p>

<p>Bitcode permits building IPAs specifically tailored for each iOS device Apple currently supports, including in the binary only the correct architecture for each of them - since I&rsquo;m on an arm64 device, the only segment Clutch found was the 64-bit one.</p>

<p>I decrypted the real breadwallet too, for the sake of comparison.</p>

<p>All these operations have been executed via SSH directly on the device, now we can take the reverse engineering process on a PC.</p>

<h2 id="a-rough-idea">A rough idea</h2>

<p>My first thought was:</p>

<pre><code>this rogue app steals Bitcoin but at the same time it's a totally legit wallet too, so it's working using the breadwallet's methods and functions to send coins to a wallet controlled by the offender.
</code></pre>

<p>this means the faker could have &ldquo;engraved&rdquo; this address in the binary.</p>

<p><code>strings</code> to the rescue!</p>

<p>A Bitcoin wallet address is simple<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>:</p>

<ul>
<li>its length goes from a minimum of 25 characters, to a max of 35</li>
<li>it starts with a &ldquo;1&rdquo; or a &ldquo;3&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, bash will help us achieve what we need:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
for line in $(cat $1); do 
	if [[ ${#line} -ge 26 &amp;&amp; ${#line} -le 35 ]]; then
		if [[ $line == 1* || $line == 3*  ]]; then
			echo $line
		fi
	fi
done
</code></pre>

<p>Running this script against the strings we took earlier, somethings pops out:</p>

<pre><code>12HzbRzNumLxnRxNY72eosNBC98bWHwE85
</code></pre>

<p>A Bitcoin address!</p>

<h2 id="sneaky-beaky-like">Sneaky-beaky like</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s a major difference between the legit binary and the fake one: a method.</p>

<p>All the interesting action happends inside the <code>BRSendViewController</code> class.</p>

<p>Inside the fake breadwallet there&rsquo;s a method called <code>makeTest</code>, which have an almost identical flow compared to the legit <code>payToClipboard</code>; this last method basically send a fixed amount of coins to the address the OS clipboard contains.</p>

<p><code>makeTest</code> does something similar: it creates a payment request for the fraud address instead of the one contained into <code>payToClipboard</code>, then displays a fake error message:</p>

<pre><code>Wallet decryption error, check phone for unwanted programs&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>tricking the user into thinking his/her phone has been hacked.</p>

<p>When the payment view will be presented, <code>makeTest</code> will be called.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>Using a common blockchain explorer we can clearly see that this address was not used until the 1st of August 2016; during the period between its first transaction and the 13 of August, this address accumulated <em>~47BTC</em>, and withdrawn everything to multiple addresses the 12 of August.</p>

<p>At the current exchange value, 47BTC can be converted to about <em>27k$</em>.</p>

<p>breadwallet is <a href="https://github.com/voisine/breadwallet/">open source</a>, this means the faker blindly cloned the repository and didn&rsquo;t even bothered changing the UI at all, but just the bundle ID and the SpringBoard app name.</p>

<p>This means Apple doesn&rsquo;t put a lot of efforts into the app review process, just a single letter changed in the name and boom, goes directly on the AppStore!</p>

<p>The review process for this kind of app (and all the Finance ones, too), needs to be completely renewed, putting more effort into finding dupes and fakes.</p>

<p>Yesterday (12 August), Apple removed the application from their stores worldwide, but I think a new fake will come up soon.</p>
