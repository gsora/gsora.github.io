Hi there, stranger!

My name is **Gianguido Sora`**, alias **peppelakappa**/**plk**/**gsora** and I'm a 20 years old italian computer science student, currently attending my second year.

I don't really like to give myself a tag when talking of software development, instead I like to introduce myself as a *young hacker* where "hacker" means someone who likes to tinker with new stuff and learning how it works, then have fun modifying it!

Even if it's not a great practice for someone who works with programming languages to declare a preferred one, my love for **Python** must be known: I like how from a starting problem you can write a solution in really short time.

Beside Python thanks to my CS course I had the pleasure to work with **C** and **Java**, which I both use when needed.

My personal preference between them is of course **C**, but don't let Oracle know that.

Anyway I use both GNU/Linux **and** OS X as my main development workspace, on a *Lenovo ThinkPad X61s* and a *Retina MacBook Pro 13"* respectively.

Of course, **VIM** on both.

Talking about what I do and like other than *CS things*, I am a guitarist and a wannabe-audiophile.

Right now, rig is made of an American Standard **Fender Stratocaster** and an Ibanez RG870QMZ, a Fender Mustang III, a pair of **Sennheiser HD 380 Pro** and a M-Audio Fast Track Pro.

My musical tastes are various, but let's say that I listen from Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd going straight into Dream Theater, Protest The Hero, crossing Periphery, Porcupine Tree, finally touching Deadmau5, Pendulum and Knife Party.

Of course **only lossless** encoding for my ears!

I really enjoy mountain-biking when possible, and good competitive game on **Counter-Strike: Global Offensive** with my team too.

You can get in touch with me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/peppelakappa) and see my code on [GitHub](http://github.com/peppelakappa), or if you have something confidential to tell me do it with [Keybase.io](http://keybase.io/gsora)!
